# DEPRECATED

This package is no longer necessary as it was used to allow injection of `Aff` and `Eff` into [Halogen](https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen)'s DSL, whereas now there are `MonadAff` and `MonadEff` instances for this type.

The [latest v3.0.0 release](https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-aff-free/releases/tag/v3.0.0) is still available if required.
